# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is the one of the most basic forms of supervised learning. As the name suggests, it analyses the line of best fit on a given dataset in order to predict further data points. It can also be used to determine which variables are the most significant predictors of a specific outcome.

# Grade Predictor
This model uses Linear Regression to predict the grade students will get on their 3rd assessment based on factors including their past two results, living situation and absences. The supervised learning environment allows for the model to check its predictions with the recorded results and provide an accuracy score, which changes every time the model is run due to the varying shuffling of the data into training and test sets.
