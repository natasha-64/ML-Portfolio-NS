## Overview
A group of tasks demonstrating my understanding of Machine Learning. This task was a portfolio and required a selection of tasks adding up to 30 points. Each coding task folder is made up of a Jupyter Notebook file (ending in '.ipynb') and contains a README.md file, which contains a description of the task. They will also contain relevent images and files to the task.

## Project Options

### Task One (5 Points) - Github Repo
Setting up GitHub Repo, complete with an organised file structure, and a README.md page with all necessary information (Project name and description, dates and references).

### Task 2 (5 Points) - Grade Predictor
This task explores Supervised Learning through the use of
[Linear Regression](Linear-Regression/GP.ipynb) in order to predict student grades.

### Task 3 (5 Points) - Diabetes Predictor
This task further explores Supervised Learning through the use of [K-NN](K-NN/KNN-Predict.ipynb) in order to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

###  Task 4 (5 Points) - K-Means
This task explores Unsupervised Learning through the use of [K-Means](K-Means/KMeans.ipynb).

### Task 5 (10 Points) - Essay
For this task, I wrote an essay titled ['A Guide to Machine Learning: Understanding the Fundamentals and Techniques.'](Essay.md)
Started on August 18, Finished on August 27.
