# K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm which is used for clustering unlabelled data. It aims to group similar data points into a fixed number (k) of groups. It works by first randomly selecting the position of a k amount of centroids, which are used to define the clusters. After this, the algorithm performs repeated corrections to the centroids, moving them to the mean of the input samples assigned to their cluster due to closeness. This repeats a set number of iterations or until no more changes are being made. It is effective in sorting data into groups.

# Classifying Iris Flowers 
This model uses K-Means in order to predict the species of an iris flower based on factors provided in the sample data such as sepal and petal length and width. It is far more accurate than the Linear Regression used in the Grade Predictor project.
